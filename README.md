# PRP-6502
Breadboard computer / CPU -- 6502 based

A few years ago, I was struck by the videos from Bean Eater and his SAP-1. Some events well out of my control
have obliged me in pausing any DIY projects. I'm back now!

I will try my best to understand the 6502 processor and create my own breadboard version of the 6502 with Logic chips only.
