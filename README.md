# PRP-6502
Breadboard computer / CPU -- 6502 based

A few years ago, I was struck by the videos from Bean Eater and his SAP-1. Some events well out of my control
have obliged me in pausing any DIY projects. I'm back now!

I will try my best to understand the 6502 processor and create my own breadboard version of the 6502 with Logic chips only.

This will too create a reson to use the full capacity my freshly restored HP 1660CS!

For the first part of my project, I will focus myself on the busses and registers creation.

After that, Control, Istructions, Flags, etc.

Lastly I will Connect a Keyboard and a tiny mini screen and will make it a wall calculator (10 digits). I will glue all the breadboards on an old Reservoir Dogs Laminated poster.

In my wildest dreams, I will make the adress and data ports available to plug something else (HDMI and 2 joysticks maybe) to play silly old games.
